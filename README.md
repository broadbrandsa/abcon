# Abcon Proposal

## Overview
This is a topline digital strategy proposal presented as a website, designed for the Abcon Group board and brand marketing managers.

The proposal outlines a strategic direction for the group's digital presence, focusing on high-level goals and audience engagement rather than granular execution details.

## Contents
The proposal website is structured into an intro page and three dedicated brand pages:

1.  **Strive Property Specialists**
2.  **Abcon Developments**
3.  **Craft Homes**

## Strategic Intent
This document and the accompanying structure serve as a guide for strategy and direction. It is not an execution plan. The focus is on aligning brand positioning, audience targeting, and go-to-market approaches to drive quality leads and growth.
